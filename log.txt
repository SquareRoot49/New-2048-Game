## Prompt 1 – 2025-07-14

**Prompt:**  
Create a simple Pygame demo where a square block is launched from the bottom of the screen when the user clicks the mouse. Each time the user clicks, a new block should be created and launched upward with a fixed speed and slight gravity effect. Display multiple blocks if the user clicks multiple times. Include basic gravity, motion update, and window setup. Use an image for the block if available, otherwise use a colored square. Provide clean and beginner-friendly Python code.

**Files Modified:**  
- `pygame_block_launcher.py`  

**Description of Change:**  
Set up the initial Pygame launcher logic:
- Initialized Pygame window with screen size and frame rate
- Created logic to spawn blocks when the user clicks
- Each block is launched upward with an initial velocity and affected by gravity
- Allowed multiple blocks to exist and update simultaneously
- Used colored rectangles to represent blocks

## Prompt 2 – 2025-07-14

**Prompt:**  
Change the current Pygame block launcher so that each block is fired from the bottom-left corner of the screen with both a horizontal and a vertical velocity. The block should move to the right while also moving upward initially, and then fall down due to gravity, following a parabolic trajectory. Use fixed initial values for horizontal and vertical velocity, and apply gravity to simulate downward acceleration. Allow multiple blocks to exist and update simultaneously.

**Files Modified:**  
- `pygame_block_launcher.py`  

**Description of Change:**  
Implemented full 2D projectile motion:
- Each block is now created at the bottom-left corner of the screen
- Blocks are given both a horizontal velocity (`vx`) and an initial upward vertical velocity (`vy`)
- Gravity is applied to the vertical velocity, creating a parabolic motion path
- Blocks fly upward and forward at first, then curve downwards as gravity increases `vy`
- Multiple blocks can move independently with their own motion

## Prompt 3 – 2025-07-14

**Prompt:**  
Upgrade the Pygame block launcher so that each block is fired from the bottom-left corner and moves toward the position where the user clicks. Compute the direction vector from the launch point to the mouse click point, normalize it, and multiply by a fixed launch speed to get the initial velocity. Apply gravity so the block follows a curved arc toward the target. Allow multiple blocks to move at the same time.

**Files Modified:**  
- `pygame_block_launcher.py`  

**Description of Change:**  
Implemented direction-based projectile control:
- Blocks are still fired from the bottom-left corner of the screen
- On mouse click, the program calculates the vector from the launcher to the mouse position
- This vector is normalized and scaled to a fixed initial speed (e.g., 10 px/frame)
- The horizontal and vertical velocities (`vx`, `vy`) are set based on the click direction
- Gravity is applied over time, affecting `vy`, resulting in a curved arc
- Now the player can control the launch angle and trajectory by clicking different parts of the screen
